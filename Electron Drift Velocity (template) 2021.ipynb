    "1. Enter your calibration data set (time values from the digital pulser versus channel numbers on the MCA) and create a line fit and calibration function.\n",
    "2. Read in your pulse-height analysis results from spreadsheets obtained during data collection.  These should contain at least three columns: (1) Applied accelerating-cage voltage, (2) peak position in channels, and (3) peak width in channels.  Recommended: use the Pandas `read_csv()` or `read_excel()` functions.  You should have a total of 4 spreadsheets: data from position 1 for the 93%-Ar/7%-CO<sub>2</sub> mixture, data from position 2 for the same  mixture, data from position 1 for the 80%-Ar/20%-CO<sub>2</sub> mixture, and data from position 2 for that mixture.\n",
    "3. Apply your calibration to the peak-position and peak-width data to convert each to time units (microseconds recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data reduction\n",
    "1. Record the necessary physical quantities needed to convert voltage to electric field divided by pressure (typically in V/cm-torr) $E/P$ and, for comparison to Zhao, et al., to electric field (at 1 atmosphere pressure) in V/cm. (You  need dimensions of the accelerating cage.) Also record the necessary quantities to convert your time measurements to velocity values in centimeters per microseconds. (You need a distance between position 1 and position 2).\n",
    "2. Create a function that allows you to interpolate between measured HV values for position 2 to obtain the estimated time at any voltage.  (This is necessary unless you have taken measurements at position 2 corresponding to every measurement taken for position 1.)  Recommended: use `scipy.interpolate.interp1d()`\n",
    "3. Create conversion functions to operate on your data sets to accomplish the conversions from time to velocity and from applied cage voltage to electric field and electric field divided by pressure.\n",
    "4. Create arrays of velocity vs. $E$ and velocity vs. $E/P$.  Then plot your results for the two mixtures on large, easy to read graphs with grids, and include them in your group notebook for discussion.\n"
